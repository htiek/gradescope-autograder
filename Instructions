This is a general autograder framework for testing C++ assignments on GradeScope.

Here's what you need to do to configure everything:

1. SPECIFY A FILE MANIFEST. Edit the file MANIFEST to contain a list of all the files you expect
   students to submit. Those files will be extracted from the submission/ directory, and the
   autograder will report an error if any of them can't be found.
   
   Recommendation: Only include files in MANIFEST that you expect students to actually edit. You
   can leave a clean copy of the starter files in the build directory.

2. SET UP THE BUILD DIRECTORY. You should include in the build/ directory enough files to make it
   possible to build all of the object files for the student code. You don't need to build a
   final executable if you don't want to - we'll be doing that when running tests.
   
   There's a default Makefile in the build directory that you're welcome to use. It just compiles
   all the .cpp files in the directory to object files.
   
3. SET UP THE TESTS DIRECTORY. Create all the files you'd like to use to run tests in the tests/
   directory. You should define tests by using the TEST_GROUP and ADD_TEST commands from TestCase.h.
   The tests in this directory will be compiled and linked against all the object files from your
   build directory.
